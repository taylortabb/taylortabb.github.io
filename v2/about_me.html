<h1>Hi!</h1>
<h2> I'm Taylor.</h2>

<h2> As an engineer, my mindset has always been that if I can build it, I'll build it, and if I can't, then I'll learn how as quickly as possible. Understanding the mechanical world, I believe, is extremely powerful. The ability to understand mechanical systems provides a great framework for me to view and asses the physical world around me. My interests have lied mostly in prototyping, mechanical design, and electro-mechanical systems. I have a strong passion for taking new  ideas and turning them into something tangible. 
<br><br>
Aside from studying Mechanical Engineering, on campus I'm a tourguide, orientation counselor, and just generally am a person who cares a lot about the communities of which I'm a part. I love improv comedy and am a part of The No Parking Players (Carnegie Mellon's most awesome Improv troupe), am an avid hiker and backpacker, a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, and occasionally a triathlete. 
<br><br>
This website is meant to serve as a portfolio for the projects I've done. To make it a little more fun, the wrench that you see as the cursor on this site actualy exists, scaled way up, as a physical tool I made <b> <a href="projects/wrench.html">here</a>. </b> </h2>

In CMU's Communication Design Fundamentals (51-262), I created <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/ttabb/Taylor%20Tabb/media/books/Fruit.pdf">Hybrid Fruits: Advanced Fruits For Beginners</a> a psuedo-text book style pamphlet exploring some of my favorite fruits! 
<br> <br>
As well as <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/ttabb/Taylor%20Tabb/media/fearposters/3%20fears.pdf"> this series of posters </a> illustrating a three nearly homophonic fears. These are not fears of mine, rather are ones I thought interesting.
<br> <br>
Finally, in Patricia Maurides course Art + The Brain, I made <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/ttabb/Taylor%20Tabb/media/books/wordsarehard.pdf"> Words Are Hard</a>, focusing on my experiance being Dyslexic.
