<h1>Projects</h1>
<h2>
In Professor Christopher Atkeson's Humanoids Robotics course, my group fabricated a <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/16264-assistiveglove/home">dexterous glove actuator</a>  that could ameliorate the process of gripping objects for those with limited grip strength.
<br> <br>
This past summer I built a <a href="projects/astro.html">radio telescope</a> to observe the Hydrogen Line.
<br> <br>
I'm also the head mechanic for <a href="projects/buggy.html">SigEp Racing</a>, a composite gravity racer team that's a part of CMU's Buggy program.
<br> <br>
In Spring of 2015, my team won our Fundamentals Of Mechanical Engineering <a href="projects/mousetrap.html">mousetrap car challenge</a> and also designed and fabricated a <a href="projects/wrench.html">wrench</a> from an aluminum bar.
<br> <br>
Here are some interesting <a href="projects/microscope.html"> microscopy photos </a> taken in a group as part of an intro materials science course I took.
<br> <br>
I've taken a number of courses on digital tooling and fabrication, and this <a href="projects/clocklamp.html">Laser Cut Clock & Paper Lamp</a> show some fun things I've done with laser cutting.

<br> <br>
I've also taken a number of Art and Design classes while at CMU, and have made a few projects about things like <a href="https://indd.adobe.com/view/100cf9fb-a708-470e-9fdf-a9b4a2fde59d">hybrid fruits</a>, being afraid of <a href="projects/fearposters.html">dogs, bicycles, and waves,</a> and <a href="projects/project_files/wordsarehard.pdf"> my experience being Dyslexic</a>

In CMU's Communication Design Fundamentals (51-262), I created <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/ttabb/Taylor%20Tabb/media/books/Fruit.pdf">Hybrid Fruits: Advanced Fruits For Beginners</a> a psuedo-text book style pamphlet exploring some of my favorite fruits! 
<br> <br>
As well as <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/ttabb/Taylor%20Tabb/media/fearposters/3%20fears.pdf"> this series of posters </a> illustrating a three nearly homophonic fears. These are not fears of mine, rather are ones I thought interesting.
<br> <br>
Finally, in Patricia Maurides course Art + The Brain, I made <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/ttabb/Taylor%20Tabb/media/books/wordsarehard.pdf"> Words Are Hard</a>, focusing on my experiance being Dyslexic.
