## Why?

On a personal level, you might want a quick way to <s>build</s> browse through your important links.

On a professional team level, you might want a stored and filterable list of predefined things to do.

## Usage

```sh
[yarn add/npm i] --dev linkdash

# Print the help menu
[yarn/npx] linkdash --help

# Create a config file
[yarn/npx] linkdash --init

# Create a dashboard and open in the browser
[yarn/npx] linkdash
```

## The config

```js
// linkdash.config.js
// notice how this is async - you may go crazy and do promise-based tasks here.

module.exports = async () => {
  return {
    title: "Welcome to my linkdash!",

    // a static list of urls to build the linkdash list from
    urls: [
      {
        title: "Visit Github",
        href: "https://github.com",
        group: "Site",

        // optional attributes
        keywords: "additional searchable text to improve searchability",
        id: "generated_id_to_tag_href_target_names",
        isBookmarked: false, // bookmarks the link by default
      },
    ],
    // [OR]
    // specifiy a host to grab the config from
    // host: "https://linkdash.now.sh/api/demo-config",

    disableOpen: false,
    output: "./linkdash.html",
    htmlHead: `
    <meta name="robots" content="noindex" />
    `.trim(),
    // automatically opens the menu
    enableAutoMenu: false,
  };
};
```

When serving a configuration via the host option, the json response needs to match this shape: [ILinkdashHostConfig](https://github.com/igimanaloto/linkdash/blob/master/src_lib/types.ts#L38). Example here: https://linkdash.now.sh/api/demo-config.

## Beyond static html

Check out the [examples folder](https://github.com/igimanaloto/linkdash/blob/master/examples) to see how linkdash can be used for cases such as running your own server (controlling the output) and using it as a personal deployment companion via git-hooks.

## Under the hood

Linkdash simply swaps the contents of a prebuilt html file with your config. Check out the [package.json ](https://github.com/igimanaloto/linkdash/blob/master/package.json) to see the four depedencies it installs!

## Other applications

- Always finding yourself trying to remember things to do after a git push or server deploy? [Use linkdash along-side githooks](https://github.com/igimanaloto/linkdash/tree/master/examples/with-git-hooks).
- Smart url schemas exist everywhere, from `mailto:`, to `tel:` to app-specific calls like `skype:`, `spotify:` and `slack:`. Get creative!
- If security and collaboration is required, you may utilise linkdash's [buildTemplate](https://github.com/igimanaloto/linkdash/tree/master/examples/templated-http-response) helper in your favourite http kernel (`express`, `http`) or `serverless function`. That way, you can decide which authorization approach to secure your links dashboard with.
- Feel free to fork to customise the html for your needs. (webpack / preact / ts)

## Future plans

[ ] Add manifest.json capabilities so the file can be installed in mobile devices.

[ ] Add a Google Sheets example
