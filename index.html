                I like building things, especially things that make people smile. I like questions; asking them and answering them, and I'm all about how the details come together to make something awesome. I like exploring new materials and methods; sometimes that means making a wool slipper from scratch, other times that means designing motor controllers. You can see my full project portfolio <a href="projects.html"><strong><strong>here</strong></strong></a>. Right now, here are some of my favorite things I've worked on:

                Most of my experience has been in mechanical design and project management, specifically in the context of interaction driven applications of engineering. The past two summers I've worked at Mattel, Inc. and Deeplocal, Inc. Where I got to put those skills to use. 
                <br><br>
                At <strong><strong><a href="http://deeplocal.com/" target="_blank">Deeplocal</a></strong></strong>, just about everything I touched was confidential, except for <a href="http://deeplocal.com/postermaker/" target="_blank">deeplocal.com/postermaker</a>, a totally custom machine built with Google, which I brought on-site to Côte d'Azur, France for activation. There, I operated the robot for executives, designers, celebrities, and engineers at the <a href="https://www.canneslions.com/" target="_blank"> Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.</a>

                <br><br>
                At <strong><strong><a href="http://www.mattel.com/" target="_blank">Mattel</a></strong></strong>, I had the great and absurd opportunity to act as a project manager for a line of die-cast cars. Managing a team of marketers, designers, and engineers, I helped bring over 50 toys to life. Toys from that summer are now on shelves in toy stores all over the planet.

            <h3>
              I’ve just finished my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, and am continuing a fifth year to finish a masters degree, also in mechanical engineering. Academically, I’ve focused on mechanical design, mechatronics, and anything having to do with motion and actuation. I'm most interested in what experiences can be created with engineering, and how people interact with the machines and devices we build.
              <br><br>
              Beyond that, I'm a tourguide, an orientation counselor, and improviser, an avid hiker and backpacker, traveler, photographer, a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, and occasionally a triathlete. I'm a person who cares a whole lot about the communities of which I'm a part.
