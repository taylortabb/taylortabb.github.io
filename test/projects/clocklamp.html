<h1>Two Design Projects: Clock Face </h1>
<div class="line"></div>
<h2>Is it a clock? Or is it just time represented in space.<br><br>
This punny clock was designed (in Rhino) and laser cut by me for my Digital Tooling (DigiTool) class in spring of 2016. From this project and many laser cutting projects after, I've become quite proficient in the use of several models and methods of laser cutting materials. (Note: I did not design or build the actual time keeping mechanism, that was purchased and pre-assembled)

<h1>Two Design Projects: Paper Lamp </h1>
<div class="line"></div>
<h2>
A paper lamp created for my Industrial Design Fundamentals class constructed only of staples and card-stock. The prompt was to create a paper lamp for a specific place with an emphasis on the form of the lamp. I created this with the intent for it to hang down as accent lighting in a dorm or bedroom space. This is probably my favorite thing I&#39;ve done with a laser cutter.<br><br>
My design professor described it as "perhaps alright!" (which means she really liked it!)
