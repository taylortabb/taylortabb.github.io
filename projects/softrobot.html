<h2>Advised by professor Chris Atkeson and Akihiko Yamaguchi, our group of 6 set out on a semester long project to fabricate a soft robotic actuator. Our intention was to build a prototype finger assist that could be used to help elderly people with limited grip strength hold and move objects in their daily life.
<br>
<br>

As the only mechanical engineer on a team with two electrical engineers, two computer scientists, and a human-computer interactionist, a lot of my responsibilities were in fabrication.  

<br><br>

While there are four basic finger grip types (full fist, hook fist, straight fist, and platform), we chose to model after the full fist, as it required the most amount of "joints," and accordingly would be an interesting challenge to pursue.

From there, we began fabrication of our mold. It took several iterations to reach this 3D printed mold for the actuator. Our biggest challenge was creating the dimensions we needed in the internal cavities, as spotting bubbles in ecoflex can be fairly challenging.

Several attempts at molding the epoxy later, we learned what teqniques work, and what don't, and yeileded three suitable actuators


using a variety of tubing, air pumps, solenoid valves, and an Arduino, I designed a pump system and array of valves to allow us control over the pressure of air in the actuator we made from a pourable silicone (Ecoflex).

After sealing together the two halfs of the actuators and testing their airtightness with a syringe, it was time to build the array of valves that would actuate the actuator. Using fish tank pumps and tiny airtight actuators, I build a system so that the soft actuator could be inflated to a specified pressure at the push of a button, and released at the button's depress.

After our computer engineer group mates finished the software part of our system, it was time for us to put it all together. As with any good project, almost nothing went right when we first tried getting it all working. We ended up needing to find a new tube off a slightly smaller diameter to fit in the actuator, and needed a faster drying silicone spread to seal parts of the valve array.

Finally, though, we got it all working! More info on the project can be found <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/16264-assistiveglove/home"><b>here</b></a>. </h2>
