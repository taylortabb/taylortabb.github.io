<h1>Mousetrap Car Challenge</h1>

<h2>

In my Fundamentals of Mechanical Engineering class (Spring 2015), I and three other team members designed and built a small mousetrap propelled vehicle with the challenge of creating the lightest weight vehicle capable of traveling the furthest distance while maintain certain design and material restrictions. Through group collaboration, <strong>our team won the competition</strong> with a novel and aesthetically pleasing design incorporating a 3D printed pulley and belt system very small and very low friction ball bearings.
