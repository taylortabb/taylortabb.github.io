<h1>Wool Slippers.</h1> 
<h4> &nbsp Monday, March 19th 2018.</h4>
<h2>In "Special Topics in Do-It-Yourself Fabrication," it was revealed that the final project is to create literally anything that brings joy to a person and employs interesting fabrication methods. 

<br> <br> I had a few ideas at first, but none that really excited me. Then I thought about the spirit of DIY and the nature of the class. When you don't have the machines or materials that would let you follow a well defined processes to get your product, how do you take the resources around you and Do Something Yourself?

<br><br>

And then it hit me. Like... like when an idea just goes "WHOOSH" through your mind and clears everything else out. I want to make slippers from scratch. I will do the following:
<br><br>
1] Find a farm that sells wool.<br>
2] Go to the farm, get some wool.<br>
3] Fabricate a mold for a slipper.<br>
4] Use wet felting to make the shoe.<br><br>

And then I will have a local, low cost, super cool looking ultra comfy pair of shoes I made myself. Potential challenges include the fact that I have literally never done any soft fabrication and don't know anything about shoes.
<br><br>
A parallel goals to all this is to bring some friends along on this adventure and see if we can't find some meaning in the experience. I think there's something interesting here; a university setting encourages building high complexity things by making tools and information more accessible (TAs, Arduino, desktop 3D printing, etc...), but a side effect of this is that we don't often engage with the lower levels of abstraction of a project. When I want to build a part, luckily I don't also have to build a computer, CAD software, and a 3D printer. But what does it feel like to build a low complexity good from scratch? Will it feel like engineering? Or more Design, Art, Science? 

<br><br>

Maybe this isn't nearly as lofty an idea as it feels like, but at the very minimum, I'll end up with a pair of slippers.

<h2> Possible Farms Identified: White Dog Farm or Wild Rose Farms. Both about 30 miles outside of Pittsburgh. Also considering a booth or clog instead or in addition to a slipper.</h2>

<h2> Submitting project proposal! Have watched like 10 hours of youtube videos on various wet felting methods.</h2>
