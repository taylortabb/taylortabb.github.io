<h1>Buggy</h1>
<h2>
(Note: This entry is significantly abbreviated due to the competitive and secretive nature of Buggy team operations) <br> <br>

Currently, I'm the head mechanic for SigEp Racing, a team that competes in Carnegie Mellon's <a href="http://cmubuggy.org/">Sweepstakes</a> (more commonly known as Buggy). I, along with our Chairman, lead a team of approximately 40 members in building, racing, and driving a composite vehicle roughly described as a 7 foot long carbon fiber torpedo on wheels. The race course is comprised of steep inclines and declines, and the buggy is powered both by human force of our push team, and by gravity as it free rolls up to nearly 40mph. My specific responsibilities include managing the use, storage, and safety, of the various tools and materials that are used to build and maintain a buggy, along with co-managing the logistics of organizing a large team of interdisciplinary members. Additionally I design our branding and logo for our gear, posters, and more.
<br><br>
All of the preparation leads up to raceday, and the weekend before raceday (known as truck weekend) during which we test all systems an ensure we're prepared for a fast and safe race. Below is a photo of me in our teams truck as we prep the buggies, drivers, and pushers. And adjacent to it, in the far right, is a our newest buggy (and pusher), HYDRA, build in 2015 and 2016 on raceday.
